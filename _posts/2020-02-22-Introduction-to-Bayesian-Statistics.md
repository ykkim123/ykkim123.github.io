Bayesian statistics is certainly one of the hottest area in modern statistics. 
<br><br>To illustrate difference between frequentist and Bayesian view, consider the following situation:   
Person A toss a coin, where
$$
  Y_{i}
$$
is a random variable that represents ith result of coin toss among N observations and follows a Bernoulli distribution, i.e.,
$$
  Y_{i} \sim Ber(\theta)
$$
that takes a value of either 1(head) or 0(tail).
